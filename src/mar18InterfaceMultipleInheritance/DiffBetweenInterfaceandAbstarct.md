In Java, both interfaces and abstract classes are used to achieve abstraction, but they serve different purposes 
and have distinct characteristics. Here's a detailed comparison:

1. Definition:
   Interface:
   A reference type that defines a contract (a set of abstract methods) that a class must implement.
   It cannot contain method implementations (except for default and static methods in Java 8+).
   Abstract Class:
   A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods 
   (with implementation).
2. Keyword:
   Interface: Defined using the interface keyword.
   interface MyInterface {
   void myMethod();
   }
   Abstract Class: Defined using the abstract keyword.
   abstract class MyAbstractClass {
   abstract void myMethod();
   void concreteMethod() {
   System.out.println("Concrete method");
   }
   }
3. method Implementation:
   Interface:
   Before Java 8, interfaces could only have abstract methods (no implementation).
   From Java 8 onwards, interfaces can have:
   Default methods (with implementation).
   Static methods (with implementation).
   Example:

   interface MyInterface {
   void myMethod(); // Abstract method
   default void defaultMethod() { // Default method
   System.out.println("Default method");
   }
   static void staticMethod() { // Static method
   System.out.println("Static method");
   }
   }
   Abstract Class:
   Can have both abstract methods (no implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).
   Example:

   abstract class MyAbstractClass {
   abstract void myMethod(); // Abstract method
   void concreteMethod() { // Concrete method
   System.out.println("Concrete method");
   }
   }
4. Variables:
   Interface:
   Variables in an interface are implicitly public, static, and final (constants).
   Example:

   interface MyInterface {
   int MY_CONSTANT = 10; // Implicitly public, static, final
   }
   Abstract Class:
   Can have instance variables, static variables, and constants.
   Example:
   abstract class MyAbstractClass {
   int myVariable = 10; // Instance variable
   static int MY_STATIC_VAR = 20; // Static variable
   }
5. Inheritance:
   Interface:
   A class can implement multiple interfaces (multiple inheritance of type).
   An interface can extend multiple interfaces.
   Example:
   interface A {}
   interface B {}
   interface C extends A, B {} // Multiple inheritance of interfaces
   class MyClass implements A, B {} // Multiple interface implementation
   Abstract Class:
   A class can extend only one abstract class (single inheritance).
   Example:

   abstract class A {}
   abstract class B extends A {} // Single inheritance
   class MyClass extends B {} // Single inheritance
6. constructor:
   Interface:
   Cannot have constructors.
   Abstract Class:
   Can have constructors (used during subclass instantiation).
   Example:

   abstract class MyAbstractClass {
   MyAbstractClass() {
   System.out.println("Abstract class constructor");
   }
   }
7. Use Case:
   Interface: 
   Used to define a contract or behavior that multiple classes can implement.
   Ideal for achieving loose coupling and multiple inheritance of type.
   Example: Runnable, Comparable, List.
   Abstract Class:
   Used to provide a common base class with shared functionality for subclasses.
   Ideal for scenarios where you want to provide a partial implementation.
   Example: InputStream, AbstractList.
8. When to Use:
   Use an interface when:
   You want to define a contract that multiple unrelated classes can implement.
   You need multiple inheritance of type.
   You want to achieve loose coupling.
   Use an abstract class when:
   You want to share code among related classes.
   You need to provide a common base class with some implementation.
   You want to control the subclassing process (e.g., restrict instantiation).
