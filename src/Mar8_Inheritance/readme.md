Garbage Collector --> it has no specific time, when it will run, it runs at any time before, middle,end of program.



String ---> thread safe
String Buffer ---> thread safe (Sync)----- if two treads are accessing at same time then its inconsistency
String Builder ---> not thread safe( do not sync) --->

## Object Oriented Programming

Object -- real world entity - physical entity
Class -- logical entity

## Pillar of OOP
1. Inheritance
   Reusability

2. Polymorphism
   Poly -- Many, morphism -- Forms (On thing behave differently in diff situation)

## Method overloading - Compile time polymorphism
## Method Overriding - Runtime polymorphism

3. Abstraction -- Hiding complex detail from user, only showing whatever is necessary i.e. Mobile Phone
 abstract -- some form of idea , overview

4. Encapsulation
 wrapping up the data into single unit
 you are only allowing user to access the data which you only want them to access
 Whatsapp --> status ---> number of users who can see the status
 banking app --- you can see only your detail.

## Data Hiding - these two come under Data hiding
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation


## Multi-level inheritance is not supported in Java directly
## Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java directly. These can be accessed by interfaces (which support it)
