Super constructor? Always first to call
this constructor ? Always first to call

both "this" and "super" constructor cannot call from same method because it's always first either super or this.
we can use i.e. this.variable = super.variable by this.


Child class constructor call Parent class constructor by using Super keyword.
## Encapsulation
Wraps the data into single unit...
programmer can control who can access what.. (i.e. wi-fi password)

## getter & setter
bydefault you should make all the fields/ data members as private no one can access it outside., so no one can access it. To access these private
members we use the Getter and Setter method.
