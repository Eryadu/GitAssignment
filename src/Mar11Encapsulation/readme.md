Super constructor?
this constructor ?

## Encapsulation
Wraps the data into single unit...
programmer can control who can access what.. (i.e. wi-fi password)

## getter & setter
bydefault you should make all the fields/ data members as private no one can access it outside., so no one can access it. To access these private
members we use the Getter and Setter method.
