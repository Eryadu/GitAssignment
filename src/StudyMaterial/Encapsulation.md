## Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the bundling of data (attributes)
and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It also involves restricting 
direct access to some of an object's components, which is a way of preventing unintended interference and misuse of the data.

Here are the key aspects of encapsulation:

1. Data Hiding: Encapsulation allows you to hide the internal state of an object and only expose a controlled interface. 
This is often achieved using access modifiers like private, protected, and public in languages such as Java, C++, and C#.
2. Controlled Access: By providing public methods (getters and setters), you can control how the internal data is accessed 
or modified. This allows you to add validation or logic when data is changed.
3. Modularity: Encapsulation helps in creating modular code. Each class can be developed and tested independently, and 
changes to the internal implementation of a class do not affect other parts of the program as long as the interface remains the same.
4. Maintainability: Encapsulation makes code easier to maintain and understand. Since the internal workings of a class 
5. are hidden, other parts of the program only need to know how to interact with the class through its public interface.
