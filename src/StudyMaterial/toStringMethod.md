## tostring Methode
The toString method is used to convert an object to a string representation. 
This is particularly useful in various scenarios:
-- Debugging and Logging: When you want to print an object to the console or log it, the toString method provides a 
   human-readable string representation of the object. 
-- String Concatenation: When you concatenate an object with a string, Java automatically calls the toString method 
   on the object to convert it to a string. 
-- Custom String Representation: By overriding the toString method in your custom objects, you can control how your 
   objects are represented as strings. This is useful for creating meaningful and readable string representations 
   of complex objects.
